Instructions for how to setup the Python Module.  
(We should make this into a script later.)

1. Update the wrapper file by running SWIG in the command line:
swig.exe -c++ -python -o mymodule_wrap.cpp mymodule.i

2. Build the .DLL file by compiling one of the .DLL projects.  One of them will link against the Python 2 library, and the other against the Python 3 library.  Make sure you build it in release mode.

3. Copy the .DLL into the folder that contains mymodule.py, and rename the .DLL to _mymodule.pyd.

4. Run python and import the module.

For example:
	"import mymodule"
	"x = mymodule.BinaryBzet(3)"
	"x.getBzetString()"
