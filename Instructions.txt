Instructions for how to setup the Python Module.  We should make this into a script.

1. To update the wrapper file by running SWIG in the command line:
swig.exe -c++ -python -o mymodule_wrap.cpp mymodule.i

2. Build the .DLL by compiling the Python DLL project.  It must be in release mode to work.

3. Copy the .DLL into the folder that has SWIG, and rename it to _mymodule.pyd

4. Run python.exe in that folder to test it.

5. In the python shell:
	"import mymodule"
	"x = mymodule.BinaryBzet()"
	"x.getBzetString()"
